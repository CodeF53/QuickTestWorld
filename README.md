## About:
Adds a new world type "testworld" for quickly making test worlds

This world type forces you into creative mode with cheats, spawning you on a single glass block.

When selected, the following gamerules are also applied automatically:
- daylight cycle off
- weather cycle off
- wandering trader off
- pillager patrols off
- phantom spawning off
